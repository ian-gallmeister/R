# Review bias and variance

Example, a roughly quadratic cloud of points.  Better to fit it with a constant, straight line, a quadratic? 

* Depends on the amount of data.
* What if you have only n=3 or 4?

Constant will have the least sampling variation but the most bias.

Quadratic will have the least bias but the most sampling variation.

## Shrinkage idea:

Make a linear combination of the constant model with the "full" model.

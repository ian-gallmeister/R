data("NCHS")
#help("NCHS")
#ggplot(data = NCHS)
NCHS %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = height)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.01)
NCHS %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = height)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.01) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = lm)

* Polynomial differentiable with continuous output an infinite number of times  
* Granted, goes to zero pretty quickly  
* $C^3$ smooth means third derivative but not fourth is continuous  
* $C^\infty$ favored  
* Position -> velocity -> acceleration -> jerk -> who gives a shit?
* Newton: interested in interpolation between points
* Interpolation really important today -- digital sound is recorded as discrete points, so want interpolated function with continuous 3rd derivative so speaker arm moves continuously and doesn't break the damn thing.
* Sink function best for sound.  Could use linear or combined quadratics etc..., but not so good

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
NCHS %>% sample_n(size = 50) %>% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = height)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + geom_smooth(method = loess)
```

* This gives a confidence band - all that's been removed is ```se = false``` from ```geom_smooth()```, and the dataset has been sampled down so the confidence is visible and not so narrow.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
NCHS %>% sample_n(size = 5000) %>% ggplot(aes(color = sex, x = age, y = height)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + geom_smooth(method = loess)
```

* Here, we split it up by gender and increase the sample size

```{r}
make_model_matrix <- function(x, basis_funs) {
  MM <- matrix(0, nrow = length(x), ncol = length(basis_funs))
  for (i in 1:length(basis_funs)) {
    MM[,i] = basis_funs[[i]](x)
  }
  return(MM)
}
```

  function(x) 1,
  function(x) x,
  function(x) x^2,
  function(x) x^3
)
